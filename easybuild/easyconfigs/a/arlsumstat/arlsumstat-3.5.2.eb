Arlequin is the French translation of "Arlecchino", a famous character of the Italian 
"Commedia dell'Arte". As a character he has many aspects, but he has the ability to switch
among them very easily according to its needs and to necessities. This polymorphic ability
is symbolized by his colorful costume, from which the Arlequin icon was designed.
