TBA, or the Threaded-Blockset Aligner, is a local multiple sequence alignment tool that
differs somewhat from a global sequence aligner. TBA is in fact a suite of tools, not just
one single executable file. While TBA can be used to align “vanilla” sequences from different
species (i.e. one FASTA sequence entry per species), it can also handle more complex
scenarios such as 1) aligning sub-sequences that originate from particular chromosomes
of genome assemblies, or 2) situations where any species’ sequence might be provided
in more than one FASTA sequence entry. The latter might occur, for example, if there
is a syntenic break in one of the species being analyzed or your sequence is a series of
unassembled contigs. With TBA, there is no need to artificially fuse these multiple sequences
together (i.e. with a rung of N’s between the contigs).
